Introduction
============

Research in ecology has long seek to understand the processes
influencing the diversity and stability of natural communities. These
communities are formed by populations whose dynamics of persistence and
extinction depends on resource availability. Seeing that the coexistence
of populations is thus constrained by feeding interactions, models have
been created equating the relationship between resources and consumers,
from the simplest, most generalist models -- such as the Lotka-Volterra
model @lotka1926,@volterra1928 -- to more tailored and parametrized
ones. Among these, @yodzis_bsc generalist resource-consumer model has
the advantage of yielding results close to the empirical observations
while needing only few, easy to assess parameters. To achieve this
purpose, it uses allometric scaling of metabolic and assimilation rates,
meaning that the flow of biomass from a resource to its consumer thus
depends on the body-mass ratio between them.

Adaptations of this model have been use to show that allometric scaling
enhances predictions regarding stability (Brose et al., 2006, Otto et
al., 2007), interaction strength (Berlow et al., 2009, Boit et al.,
2012, Iles et Novak, 2016) and perturbation spread (Iles et Novak, 2016)
within large, realistic food webs. Yet, although these authors used the
same model, they used personal adaptation and implementation of it. Here
we present `befwm`, a Julia package implementing @brose_ase adaptation
of @yodzis_bsc bio-energetic model for food-webs (@williams_hyi) with
updated allometric coefficients. This package aims at offering an
efficient common ground for modeling food-webs dynamics using this
particular model.

The model
=========

Biomass dynamics
----------------

We implement the model as described by @brose_ase, which is itself
explained in greater detail in @williams_hyi. This model describes the
flows of biomass across trophic levels, primarily defined by body size.
It distinguishes population based on two highly influential variables
for the metabolism and assimilation rates, body-mass and metabolic type.
Once this distinction made, it model populations as simple stocks of
biomass growing and shrinking through consumer-resources interactions
(@williams_hyi). The governing equations below describe the changes in
relative density of producers and consumers respectively.

\begin{equation}\label{e:producer}
B'_i = r_i(1-\frac{B_i}{K}) B_i -\sum_{j \in \text{consumers}}\frac{x_jy_jB_jF_{ji}}{e_{ji}}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{e:consumer}
B'_i = -x_iB_i+\sum_{j \in \text{resources}} x_iy_iB_iF_{ij}-\sum_{j \in \text{consumers}}\frac{x_jy_jB_jF_{ji}}{e_{ji}}
\end{equation}
where $B_i$ is the biomass of population $i$, $r_i$ is the mass-specific
maximum growth rate, $K$ is the carrying capacity, $x_i$ is $i$'s
mass-specific metabolic rate, $y_i$ is $i$'s maximum consumption rate
relative to its metabolic rate, $e_{ij}$ is $i$'s assimilation
efficiency when consuming population j and $F_{ij}$ is the
multi-resources functional response of $i$ consuming $j$:

\begin{equation}\label{e:func_resp}
F_{ij}=\frac {\omega_{ij}B_{j}^{h}}{B_{0}^{h}+c_iB_iB_{0}^{h}+\sum_{k=resources}\omega_{ik}B_{k}^{h}}
\end{equation}
Depending on the parameters $h$ and $c$ the functional response can take
several forms (see \autoref{tab:parameters}).

As almost all organism metabolic characteristics vary predictably with
body-mass (@brown_tmt), these variations can be described by allometric
relationships as described in @williams_hyi and @brose_ase. Hence, the
biological rates of production, metabolism and maximum consumption
follow negative power-law relationships with the typical adult body-mass
(@enquist_asp,@brown_tmt). After normalizing and simplifying these
relationships, it results that the mass-specific metabolic rate $x_i$ is
a function of both metabolic type and body-mass (see \autoref{}), while
the maximum consumption rate $y_i$ is influenced only by the metabolic
type and the assimilation efficiency $e_{ij}$ is function of $i$'s diet
(herbivore or carnivore).

$$
x_i = \frac {a_x} {a_r} (\frac {M_C} {M_P})^{-0.25}
$$

The subscripts P and C refer to producers and consumers populations
respectively, M is the typical adult body-mass and $a_r$, $a_x$ and
$a_y$ are the allometric constant (see \autoref{tab::parameters}).

Measures on output
------------------

The `befwm` package implements a variety of measures that can be applied
on the output of simulations.

Shannon's entropy

:   Diversity within the community is measured through Shannon's
    entropy, corrected for the total number of populations. This returns
    values in $]0;1]$, where $1$ indicates that all populations have the
    same biomass.

Total biomass

:   The total biomass within the community is simply defined as the sum
    of all biomasses at a given time.

Stability

:   As in @brose_ase, we measure stability as being the negative of the
    coefficient of variation of biomasses of each population over a
    fixed number of timesteps. These are averaged, to give a measure
    representing the overall fluctuation of biomasses within
    the community. Values close to 0 are stable, and increasingly
    negative values are unstable.

Implementation and availability
===============================

The `befwm` package is available for the `julia` programming language,
and has been tested with releases `0.3` (legacy), `0.4` (current as of
writing), and `0.5` (development) on Linux and Mac OS X. The package can
be installed from the `julia` REPL using

``` {.julia}
Pkg.add("befwm")
```

The code is released under the MIT license. This software note describes
version `0.1.0`. The code is mirrored at
`https://github.com/PoisotLab/befwm.jl`, and we welcome potential
contributions. The code is version-controlled, undergoes continuous
integration, and has a code coverage of approx. 90% to this date.

Use cases
=========

Documentation is available online at
<https://www.gitbook.com/book/poisotlab/befwm/details>, and can be
downloaded as a printable PDF. The documentation includes several
use-cases, as well as discussion of some design choices. All functions
in the package have an in-line documentation, available from the `julia`
interface.

In this section, we will describe two use-cases (the code to execute
them is given in the manual, and is attached as Supp. Mat. to this
paper).

Illustration of the temporal dynamics
-------------------------------------

We will investigate the temporal dynamics of total biomass (sum of
biomasses of all populations), and of diversity (Shannon's index of
biomasses) across 50 replicate simulations. Every simulation uses a
different network (generated with the niche model, 20 species,
connectance of $0.25 \pm 0.01$).

\begin{figure}[bt]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/temporal_dynamics.pdf}
    \caption[Example figure.]{With the default parameters, a food web with 20 populations and a connectance of 0.25 reaches a stable state within the first 100 timesteps. The solid line represents the average value across 50 independant runs, and the ribbon around it is the standard deviation.}
    \label{temporal}
\end{figure}
We run the simulations with the default parameters (given in
`?make_initial_parameters`, and in the manual). Each simulation consists
of the following code:

``` {.julia}
# We generate a random food web
A = nichemodel(20, 0.25)

# This loop will keep on trying food webs until
# one with a connectance close enough to 0.25
# is found
while abs(befwm.connectance(A) - 0.25) > 0.01
    A = nichemodel(20, 0.25)
end

# Prepare the simulation parameters
p = A |> make_initial_parameters |> make_parameters

# We start each simulation with random biomasses
# in ]0;1[
bm = rand(size(A, 1))

# And finally, we simulate over 500 timesteps
out = simulate(p, bm, start=0, stop=500,
        steps=1500, use=:ode45)
```

The results are presented in \autoref{temporal}. With this choice of
parameters, the community reaches stability within 100 timesteps.

Effect of allometric scaling on stability and diversity
-------------------------------------------------------

We now illustrate how the package can be used to explore responses of
the system to changes in parameters. In particular, we explore how
diversity and population stability are affected by an increase in
connectance. The results are presented in \autoref{scaling}.

\begin{figure}[bt]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/scaling}
    \caption[Example figure.]{This is a figure.}
    \label{scaling}
\end{figure}
The allometric scaling is controlled by the parameter $Z$ (field `:Z` in
the code), and can be changed in the following way:

``` {.julia}
# Prepare the simulation parameters
p = make_initial_parameters(A)
# Change the scaling
p[:Z] = scaling[i]
# Finishes the simulation parameters
p = make_parameters(p)
```

Note that the value of `:Z` *has* to be changed before `make_parameters`
is called. This is because `make_parameters` will calculate the
allometry for the different populations based on $Z$, their trophic
rank, etc. These parameters are calculated only once, which allows an
efficient implementation of the model.
