    caption: Effect of increasing the carrying capacity of the resource for different levels of competition ($\alpha \in \left[0.9, 1.1\right]$). For conditions of neutral coexistence or coexistence ($\alpha \leq 1$), diversity is stable until $K \approx 5$. For conditions of competition exclusion ($\alpha > 1$), diversity increases for $K < 5$, and decreases after.

    caption: The peak of stability, in terms of allometric scaling, differs between vetebrates and invertebrates. Note that the \emph{y} axis is reversed, since more negative values indicate less variation, and therefore more temporal stability. The sahded area represents negative scaling, \emph{i.e.} predators are smaller than their preys.
    short: Stability as a function of organism type and allometric scaling.

  - id: connectance
    caption: Although maximal species persistence is reach for values of inter-specific competition lower than unity, the increased trophic control at higher connectances allow coexistence even under stronger competition. The shaded area represents values of $\alpha$ smaller than unity, \emph{i.e.} coexistence is favored.
    short: Connectance and competition affect species persistence.
