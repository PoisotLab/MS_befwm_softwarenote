    caption: With the default parameters, a food web with 20 populations and a connectance of 0.25 reaches a stable state within the first 100 timesteps. The solid line represents the average value across 50 independant runs, and the ribbon around it is the standard deviation.

    caption: When varying allometric scaling, the model exhibits a range of behaviors, with maximal diversity and stability reached for either no, or positive but weak, scaling.
