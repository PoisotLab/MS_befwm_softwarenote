    caption: Effect of increasing the carrying capacity of the resource for different levels of competition ($\alpha \in \left[0.9, 1.1\right]$). For conditions of neutral coexistence or coexistence ($\alpha \leq 1$), diversity is stable until $K \approx 5$. For conditions of competition exclusion ($\alpha > 1$), diversity increases for $K < 5$, and decreases after.
    short: Effect of varying the carrying capacity.

    caption: The peak of stability, in terms of allometric scaling, differs between vetebrates and invertebrates. Note that the \emph{y} axis is reversed, since more negative values indicate less variation, and therefore more temporal stability. The sahded area represents negative scaling, \emph{i.e.} predators are smaller than their preys.
    short: Stability as a function of organism type and allometric scaling.

  - id: connectance
    caption: Although maximal species persistence is reached for values of inter-specific competition lower than unity, the increased trophic control at higher connectances allow coexistence even under stronger competition. The shaded area represents values of $\alpha$ smaller than unity, \emph{i.e.} coexistence is favored.
    short: Connectance and competition affect species persistence.

abstract: \textbf{1.} Food webs are the backbone upon which biomass flows through ecosystems. Dynamical models of biomass can reveal how the structure of food webs is involved in many key ecosystem properties, such as persistence, stability, etc..\newline\textbf{2.}  In this contribution, we present \texttt{befwm}, an implementation of the bio-energetic model, in the high-performance computing language Julia.\newline\textbf{3.} We illustrate how this package can be used to conduct numerical experiments in a reproducible and standard way.\newline\textbf{4.} A reference implementation of this widely used model will ease reproducibility and comparison of results across studies.
